# MycoForge

MycoForge is a Rust (another) library designed to run genetic programming experiments. 
*(Hopefully)* It will provide a flexible set of tools and utilities to help researchers and practitioners implement, run, and analyze genetic programming algorithms with a focus on ease of use and extensibility. 

## Overview

Genetic programming is a method of evolving computer programs to solve complex problems using principles inspired by biological evolution. 
MycoForge aims to streamline the process of setting up genetic programming experiments, allowing users to focus on their specific research questions rather than implementation details.
